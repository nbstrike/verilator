Thanks for taking the time to report this.

What would you like added/supported?

What 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?

Can you attach an example that runs on other simulators?  (Must be openly licensed, completely self-contained and self-checking so can directly run what you provide. Ideally use test_regress format, see https://veripool.org/guide/latest/contributing.html?highlight=test_regress#reporting-bugs

May we assist you in trying to fix this in Verilator yourself?
